# CEnet
CEnet semantic segmentation, a simple matlab finished network
The main function is DACblock and RMPblock, which is very important in CEnet;
we test the in Landsat8 remote sensing image to detect the ice,the result is very nice,
if you want to use this code, you need to modify the inputLayer, because my inputLayer is different from natural image,
if you have any question, please contact me, Email:1044625113@qq.com
